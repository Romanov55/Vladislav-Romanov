Hello. I'm Vlad and currently I'm studying at the Frontend developer courses at: https://ru.hexlet.io, in addition you can find my ready-made projects on https://github.com/Romanov55?tab=repositories;

I graduated from the Omsk College of Transport Construction and my qualification was - Technician.
Then I worked as Commodity operator at “Gazprom Neft Lubricants” LLC also as an operator for the preparation of raw materials and products at JSC “Omsky Kauchuk”

Despite that my education and occupation were connected with the oil and gas industry, but i`ve always dreamt that one day I will work in the IT field.

At the moment I am actively studying and developing new skills and knowledges and I work with JavaScript, GitHub, HTML, CSS;

Moreover i currently live in the Rudny city, Kostanay region, Kazakhstan;
I am looking for a job and ready to relocate or work online;

In conclusion I've always had this craving for the profession of a developer and now I think that the time has come.
